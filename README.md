## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

my purpose of doing this challenge was to get familiar with React after I learned it, so it was enough for me to make desktop only.
it was hard to deal with css and I think that using Tailwind will make things very easy.
